# emergent-spacetime-quantum-circuits
Exploration of emergent physical phenomena, including spacetime signatures, through entanglement and entropy analysis of quantum circuits. This repository contains the Qiskit code, raw data, and image generation scripts for experiments conducted on IBM Quantum hardware and Aer simulators, as detailed in the associated arXiv paper.
